Hi there!

Click on the tools tab as you would when selecting your board type and navigate to boards manager and install: Nordic Semiconductor nRF5 Boards

Once your installation is done, copy "Blink LED" code and paste it onto your sketch.
Take note of the following peripheral under Tools:
 Board is on: "BBC-Micro:Bit"

Before you upload your code do download the "Microbit BTLE Adv Demo" HEX file and drag it onto the microBitdrive.
